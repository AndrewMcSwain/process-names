iterator problems
repeats empty array, 
then the same entries a seemingly random number of times (8,11,14,16,11)
recognizes charCode for space[confirmed], but doesn't recognize charCode for newline
therefore all entries go into firstNameBuff

is_firstname = never returns false

i used the wrong symbol sequence to reassign the value of is_firstname 
which functions as a switch between firstNamesArray and lastNamesArray,
sending the data stream of f[index] to one array or the other. 
i had written is_firstname===false instead of is_firstname = false
