# first-tier priority 
## (potential breakage and edge cases)

- add lastname firstname order
- if white space trim whitespace
- related edge case whitespace on first entry (current structure cannot account for is_space === true && is_firstname === true at fullFileArray[0]


# second-tier priority 
## (functionality: integration with db, network, and data-processing stack)

- coerce to JSON objects
- SQL wrappers
- scrapers
- run on cloud

# third-tier priority
## things that would be nice to have, but aren't a priority

- refactor: consider the utility of generalizing data manipulation logic (space becomes isTriggerSymbol which can account for commas and capitalization etc; newline becomes nextEntry; isFirstName becomes isFirstAtr)

- use gaming engine and VR to create a fluid 
interface for presentation and manipulation of data
create a media-rich subjective experience for
market research. where the operator-agent (marketing
research specialist) is the primary store of learning
knowledge and conclusions-generation.
